After almost 3 months after the previous stable release, we decided to release 1.6.3.

It's a maintance release with a couple of UI improvements and a few bugfixes.

After a lot of discussion, all the people involved with the development decided
to move to `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ and to `GitHub <https://github.com/mpc-hc/mpc-hc>`_ for hosting the source.

We would like to thank pigoz and the `mplayer2 project <http://www.mplayer2.org>`_
for making their web site's template publicly available for usage.

I slightly tweaked their template and updated dependencies to use the latest
`FancyBox <http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/>`_.
