After almost 1 and a half month since the last stable build, we decided to release 1.6.7.

This release is mainly a bugfix release. It also has a big performance improvement
when using an INI file to store the settings.

After 3 months since the last stable build, we decided to release 1.6.6.

This release has many bugfixes and a few new features. Also, the binaries :doc:`are digitally signed </2013/02/25/binaries-are-signed>`
so you can easily verify their integrity.
