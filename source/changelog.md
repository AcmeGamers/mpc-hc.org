* New:
  * Ability to control playback repeat mode
  * Add a cache to avoid recompiling pixel shaders when possible
  * Add SVG support for custom toolbars
  * Add Bosnian translation
  * Option to set audio delay values for each display mode
* Changed:
  * Old DirectX 7 renderers have been removed. Settings will be updated automatically to use the corresponding VMR-9 renderers.
    If you really want to use a renderer similar to VMR-7 (windowed), use Overlay mixer or the "System Default" renderer
  * Make Video Renderer statistics scalable to window size and unify graph look for EVR Sync and other renderers
  * "Replace currently loaded subtitles" option no longer removes subtitles provided by splitter
  * Change Pan&Scan logic:
    * PnS Rotate Y- now flips horizontally
    * PnS Rotate X- now flips vertically
    * PnS Rotate Z- now rotates 90 degrees (counter-clockwise)
    * The postive rotate functions still do 1 degree rotation around their axis
  * Hide the infobar in normal view preset. This makes it equal to default view
  * Ticket {% trac 2022 %}/{% trac 4779 %}: Rewrite subtitles downloading framework

    * LAV Splitter: Support demuxing H264 MVC
    * Ticket {% trac 5815 %}, LAV Splitter: Improve the detection of the forced flag for some MP4 subtitle tracks
    * LAV Video Decoder: Add experimental support for VP9 DXVA2 decoding (disabled by default)
    * LAV Video Decoder: Enable hardware decoding for HEVC and 4K/UHD by default
    * LAV Video Decoder: Add a basic H264 MVC decoder based on Intel MediaSDK.
      Note that for now the Intel MediaSDK library is not distributed with MPC-HC.
      If you want to use this new decoder, you have to download the library
       * 32-bit: http://files.1f0.de/lavf/plugins/libmfxsw32-v1.7z
       * 64-bit: http://files.1f0.de/lavf/plugins/libmfxsw64-v1.7z
      and decompress it to the LAVFilters(64) folder.

    * Ticket {% trac 3974 %}, LAV Video Decoder: Fix DXVA decoding of interlaced H.264 videos on some Intel GPU
    * Ticket {% trac 5666 %}, LAV Video Decoder: YADIF deinterlacing sometimes caused black screen in DVD menus
