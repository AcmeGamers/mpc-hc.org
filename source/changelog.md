## 1.7.4 - 16 April 2014
* New:
  * New Bengali and Tatar translations
  * Support for opening "icyx://" stream URLs
  * Ticket {% trac 2348 %}/{% trac 3583 %}, Automatically refresh the information bar and title bar so that the correct information
    is always shown for streaming (e.g. online radios)
  * Ticket {% trac 4043 %}, Statistic: Show playback rate for audio files
* Changed:
  * If MPC-HC is configured to override the splitter choice when doing the initial track selection,
    tracks selected at splitter level will be preferred in case more than one tracks match the criteria
  * The "Jump to" menu has been split in several smaller submenus displayed in the "Navigate" menu
    depending on the media currently playing

    Note that AviSynth is still required even if LAV Splitter is used

    Russian, Slovenian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese translations
* Fixed:
  * Properties dialog: Some tracks could have been missing from the streams list

    top-right OSD size consistent and improve the behavior when the text is too big to be displayed entirely
  * VMR-7 renderless: subtitles were not displayed except in fullscreen
  * Ensure dynamic menus dependent on the currently playing media are updated when the media changes while a menu is opened
