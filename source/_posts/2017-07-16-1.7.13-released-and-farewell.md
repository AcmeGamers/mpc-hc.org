v1.7.13, the latest, and probably the *last* release of our project...


For quite a few months now, or even years, the number of active developers has been decreasing
and has inevitably reached zero.
This, unfortunately, means that the project is officially dead and this release would be the
last one.

...*Unless* some people step up that is.

So, if someone's willing to really contribute and **has C/C++ experience**, let me know on IRC
or via e-mail.

Otherwise, all things come to an end and life goes on. It's been a nice journey and I'm personally
pretty overwhelmed having to write this post.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed in any way all these years; Remember, MPC-HC is an 11-year
old project.

Don't forget, that our official builds, both the stable and the beta builds,
[are digitally signed](/2013/02/25/binaries-are-signed/).
Be aware of scams and only get the files from our site!

Also, to report bugs, suggestions and generally provide feedback, use our [Trac](https://trac.mpc-hc.org/);
reporting anything on social media or in any other place is just pointless, as the developers only follow Trac.

You can download the new version [here](/downloads/).
For the complete changes see the [changelog](/changelog/).
