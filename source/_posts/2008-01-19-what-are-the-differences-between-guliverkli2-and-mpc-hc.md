title: What are the differences between guliverkli2 and mpc-hc?
---

Gabest, the original author of Media Player Classic, stop working on it by the end of 2006.
Since then, two forks have been created.

The main differences are that Guliverkli2 contains a few patches made by various people,
and MPC-HC contains new features. Most patches present in Guliverkli2 are also present in MPC-HC.
