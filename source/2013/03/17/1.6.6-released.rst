------------------

Posted by Armada,Underground78,XhmikosR on 17/03/2013

After 3 months since the last stable build, we decided to release 1.6.6.

This release has many bugfixes and a few new features.

Highlights of this release:

* Uncompressed RAR files can now be played directly in MPC-HC (thanks to RARFileSource)
* The Subtitle menu now shows all available subtitle tracks
* "Now playing" information can now be sent to Skype's mood message, MSN support has been removed
* VSync is now turned off by default due to playback issues

You can download the new version :doc:`here </downloads>`. For the complete changes see the :doc:`changelog </changelog>`.
