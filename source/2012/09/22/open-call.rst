Open call for developers
------------------------

Posted by vBm on 22/09/2012

We are in dire need of new developers of any kind.
If you can code a little, or you can create logos for the player and images for the file associations, or you can create/maintain the main website, please join our `IRC channel <webchat.freenode.net/?channels=mpc-hc,#mpc-hc-dev>`_ and talk to us. Any help is always appreciated.

Find some easy ticket on our `trac page <https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mpc-hc/report/1>`_, fix the problem, send a `pull request <https://github.com/mpc-hc/mpc-hc/pulls>`_, or post the patch on `trac <https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mpc-hc/>`_ or come on `IRC <webchat.freenode.net/?channels=mpc-hc,#mpc-hc-dev>`_ and we'll review it for you.
