We would like to thank pigoz and the `mplayer2 project <http://www.mplayer2.org>`_
for making their web site's template publicly available for usage.

I slightly tweaked their template and updated dependencies to use the latest
`FancyBox <http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/>`_.

This website is now powered by `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ and
is open source: the code is available over at
`GitHub <https://github.com/mpc-hc/website>`_â€”contributions
in the form of pull requests are really welcome!
